# Personal Website and Portfolio

This repository contains the codebase for my personal website and portfolio. Initially, I had a website built with Wix, but I transitioned to this Next.js-based solution in early 2024 to gain more control and flexibility.

## Project Overview

This website serves as a central hub for my personal brand and professional work. It showcases my projects, thoughts, and provides a way to connect with me. The base and front-end design were initially crafted by Rambadan Pandey, also known as TechnoStart.

### Decentralization Philosophy

One of the core principles behind this website's architecture is decentralization. To minimize single points of failure and enhance reliability, I have intentionally linked main documents to Google Drive and other relevant webpages to Notion. This approach ensures that critical content remains accessible even if one platform experiences issues.

## Getting Started
