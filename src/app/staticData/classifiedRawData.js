          "The Static Time Theory proposes that time is still, while the universe moves through time in a higher dimension called hyperspace, this explains phenomena like the universe's origin, black, white holes and Uneven Matter-Antimatter Distribution. Time's stillness means an object's speed through time depends inversely on its mass. The universe's motion through hyperspace caused its formation, with the Big Bang being the start of this motion, not an explosion. Black holes are seen as rips in spacetime, allowing objects to enter hyperspace, while white holes let them return. The universe's expansion is linked to its motion in hyperspace; faster movement means more expansion. While still under development, the Static Time Theory offers a unique perspective on time and the universe.",
